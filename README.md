# ViBE (Visual Backlog Extractor) ðŸš€

ViBE is a lightweight tool designed to assist in backlog creation by analyzing app mockups and automatically generating actionable backlog items such as **functional requirements**, **epics**, **user stories**, and **tasks**. 

## Key Features
- **Upload App Mockups**: Easily upload multiple app screenshots or designs.
- **AI-Powered Backlog Generation**: Automatically generates detailed backlog items, including:
  - Functional Requirements
  - Epics
  - User Stories
  - Tasks
- **Step-by-Step Workflow**: Generates backlog items sequentially, where each artifact depends on the previous one.
- **Editable Artifacts**: Manually refine generated items before saving.
- **Export Options**: Export results in text or JSON formats.

   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
